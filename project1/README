c. Making the chdir internal is required because the chdir() call must be made within the 
   shell process. Calling it from a forked process will do nothing to the working directory
   of the shell.

   The exit command for the same reason.  If it is internal, you can simply call the exit()
   function and do not have to try to kill the shell process from a forked process.

   We implemented '.' internally.  When the command is given, the shell calls a locally
   defined function that simply reads a line and passes it to exececute_command call within 
   a loop. Doing it this way saves the overhead of forking a new process.  It basically just 
   transfers control from the user entry loop to a file entry loop which operates very 
   similarly.
